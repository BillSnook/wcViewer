### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command, if not installed already:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Then, run the following command in the wcViewer directory containing the wcViewer.xcworkstation file:

```bash
$ pod install
```
